## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Crawl4AI with OpenAI's Swarm framework to create an intelligent marketing assistant. It uses a team of specialized AI agents to analyze websites, generate marketing insights, and create campaign ideas.

## Features

1. **Multi-Agent System**: Uses OpenAI's Swarm to coordinate multiple specialized agents.
2. **Web Scraping**: Employs Crawl4AI to extract content from websites.
3. **Content Cleaning**: Processes raw HTML into clean, readable text.
4. **Content Analysis**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models to analyze website content.
5. **Campaign Idea Generation**: Creates innovative marketing campaign concepts based on target audience and goals.
6. **Marketing Copy Creation**: Generates compelling marketing copy based on campaign ideas.
7. **File Output**: Saves all generated content as separate markdown files.

## Agents

1. **User Interface Agent**: Manages user interactions and coordinates other agents.
2. **Web Scraper Agent**: Extracts and cleans website content using Crawl4AI.
3. **Analyst Agent**: Analyzes website content and provides marketing insights.
4. **Campaign Idea Agent**: Generates marketing campaign ideas.
5. **Copywriter Agent**: Creates marketing copy based on campaign ideas.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [Crawl4AI](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) library
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- [OpenAI Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) library

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/joshpocock/stride-swarm-crawl4ai-marketing-agent.git
   cd 002-stride-swarm-crawl4ai-marketing-agent
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install OpenAI Swarm:
   ```
   pip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git
   ```
   Or, if you have SSH access:
   ```
   pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/openai/swarm.git
   ```

5. Set up your environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to start the interactive demo:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Enter a URL when prompted to analyze a website.

3. Provide target audience and marketing goals when asked.

4. The system will generate and save the following files in a folder named after the website's domain:
   - `full_website_content.md`: Clean, readable version of the entire website content.
   - `website-content.md`: Extracted content based on marketing relevance.
   - `analysis.md`: Marketing analysis of the website content.
   - `campaign_idea.md`: Generated marketing campaign idea.
   - `marketing_copy.md`: Created marketing copy based on the campaign idea.
   - `marketing-plan.md`: A comprehensive marketing plan including all the above elements.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of each agent by modifying their instructions and functions in the `main.py` file. Some ideas for customization:

- Adjust the Crawl4AI extraction strategy parameters in the `scrape_website` function.
- Modify the prompts for each agent to focus on specific marketing aspects.
- Add new agents or functions to expand the system's capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with Crawl4AI, ensure you have the latest version installed:
  ```
  pip install --upgrade crawl4ai
  ```
- For OpenAI API errors, check that your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file.
- Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed, as OpenAI Swarm requires this version.
